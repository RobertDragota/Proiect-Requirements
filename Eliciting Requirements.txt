This project focuses on designing and developing a digital platform that supports psychological therapy by enhancing communication, continuity of care and administrative efficiency. In developing the system, we considered the needs of all key parties involved. The following section identifies the primary stakeholders and their roles in shaping the system’s requirements.

Stakeholders Identified
•	Primary Client (Psychologist): A licensed psychologist who initiated the project. She will use the app’s professional features. Her goals are to reduce administrative overhead, monitor patient progress between sessions, and improve patient engagement. As the domain expert, her input is crucial in defining requirements.
•	Patients (Therapy Clients): End-users on the patient side of the app. They will use features like mood journaling, therapeutic exercises, and secure messaging. Their needs (ease of use, privacy, feeling supported between sessions) are central to the app’s success. The psychologist represents their interests based on her experience with clients.
•	Development Team: Our team of four analysts/developers building the app. We are stakeholders in terms of feasibility and design. We used our technical perspective to brainstorm solutions and ensure the requirements are realistic and clear. (While not end-users, our input helped translate the psychologist’s vision into concrete features.)
•	Regulatory and Professional Bodies: Indirect stakeholders that influence requirements. For example, Colegiul Psihologilor din România (Romanian Psychologists’ Board) and data protection laws (GDPR/HIPAA) set standards for confidentiality, record-keeping, and privacy. The app must comply with these legal and ethical guidelines.
•	Peer Psychologists (Future Users): In the future, other therapists in Romania may use this platform. We kept in mind that features should be useful to them as well, not just the initial client. (For example, integration with insurance systems or bilingual support could benefit many practitioners and their patients.) These stakeholders were not directly interviewed in this phase, but the client’s experience and knowledge of similar tools guided us in considering their needs.
Elicitation Techniques Used
We employed three requirements elicitation techniques to gather information for the project: Document Analysis, an Interview with the Client, and a Team Brainstorming Session. Below we describe each technique, why we chose it, how we conducted it, who was involved and what requirements we identified from it.
1. Document Analysis
We analyzed the client’s written draft (“Instrument complementar terapiei”) and related materials to extract relevant requirements. Document analysis involves reviewing existing documentation to identify key information and needs.
The main document was the client’s concept outline describing features for patients and psychologists under the conceptual name “PSYCare România.” We also reviewed similar apps’ feature lists and domain-specific regulations (e.g., GDPR compliance).
This method was ideal because the client had already prepared a detailed draft. Document analysis provides a solid foundation by capturing what stakeholders have already defined and highlighting any gaps or unspoken requirements. Reviewing competitor and regulatory documents also ensured alignment with industry standards.
Each team member reviewed the client’s document, highlighted key points, and compiled a list of requirements and follow-up questions. We cross-checked these with competitor features to validate completeness. This produced a preliminary, evolving requirements list that we refined throughout the elicitation process.

Identified Requirements (from Document Analysis): Based on the document review, we extracted the following features and preliminary requirements for the app (as stated or implied in the documents):

2. Interview with the Client
We conducted a semi-structured interview with the primary stakeholder - the client, who is a clinical psychologist - to clarify and expand on the requirements from her perspective. The interview took place on October 10th at 16:00 via an online Teams meeting. Our entire team of four was present. 
Before the meeting, we prepared a list of questions. We used a semi-structured format, meaning we had planned questions but also let the conversation flow naturally. This allowed us to ask new questions based on the client’s responses and seek clarification on any unclear points from the document analysis.
We obtained the client’s consent to record the conversation for note-taking purposes. After the interview, we reviewed the recording and our notes to extract the key information and any additional requirements mentioned. This interview was crucial in capturing the stakeholder’s own words and priorities and it helped us understand the reasoning behind certain features. It also allowed the client to introduce new ideas that were not in the original document and to emphasize which features were most essential from her perspective.
An interview with the client was an obvious choice because it enables direct communication and rich information gathering. This one-on-one (or one-on-team) session let us explore the client’s vision in depth. Unlike just reading a document, we could ask “why” certain features are needed, probe into how she expects them to work and uncover any implicit requirements. It also helped build a good working relationship and trust with the client, which is important for ongoing collaboration. Interviews are one of the most effective techniques to elicit requirements because they provide immediate clarification and the chance to understand stakeholder needs and expectations in detail.
The interview was with the client, who is a licensed psychologist and the initiator of the project (the primary stakeholder). We did not interview other stakeholders (patients or other psychologists) at this early stage; instead, the client acted as the representative voice of end-users based on her professional experience. All four members of our development team participated in the meeting.
During the interview, we covered many questions. Here are a few key questions we asked and a summary of the client’s answers (in her own words, as closely as possible):
•	Q: What are the essential features you want the patient side of the app to have?
A: The client emphasizes the need for an emotional journal. She clarified that this isn’t just a private diary; it’s a “therapeutic” tool for the patient, but it must also be visible to the psychologist. Alongside this, she wants an “emotional thermometer” (a daily check-in scale of how the client is feeling). A critical safety feature is the “panic button” that will alert the psychologist. For high-risk patients, she also requested an “open chat”. Finally, the app should provide educational video resources or “animes”, but these must be in a separate feed so patients can access them voluntarily.
•	Q: What features do you need on the psychologist’s side of the app?
A: “A critical requirement for the psychologist’s side is the need for two interfaces. The psychologist must see the patient’s data, but the patient cannot see the psychologist’s data. This allows the psychologist to write private notes while presenting the patient with information and advice.
•	Q: At the end of a live session, would it be useful for you to have a section to complete a form or report about that session?
A: “Yes, after every session, the psychologist fills out a “report”. This document notes “elements of progress or regress” and professional observations, which are private from the patient.
Identified Requirements (from Interview): From the client interview, we confirmed many of the requirements from the document and also gathered additional ones or clearer details. Key requirements stated by the client include:
•	The system must be multi-platform, usable on both mobile and desktop, with synchronized data.
•	The system must provide two distinct interfaces: one for patients/clients and one for psychologists.
•	The system must implement strict role-based access control, ensuring that:
•	Psychologists can view patient data.
•	Patients cannot view therapist-only notes or diagnoses.
•	Therapists choose what information to share and when.
•	The system must enable secure, encrypted communications (text and video) built directly into the platform.
•	The system must avoid exposing users to third-party platforms (e.g., Google Meet) where privacy risks are higher.
•	The system must safely handle external resources and links to prevent user exposure to unsafe content or phishing.
•	The system must include a calendar/session-tracking feature that records session dates, counts, and upcoming appointments.
•	The system must allow flexible session scheduling frequencies, adjustable by the therapist.
•	The system must provide a daily emotional self-rating tool (e.g., 1–5 or 1–10 scale), optionally visualized with color states.
•	The system must include a journal for the patient to record thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, which can be shared with the therapist.
•	The system must enable therapists to review week-to-week patient progress across emotions, thoughts, and behavioral patterns.
•	The system must allow therapists to complete per-session summaries and feedback notes.
•	The system must provide a dashboard for therapists to quickly view patient status and new journal entries without intrusive notifications.
•	The system must store emergency contact details (“circle of safety”) for each patient.
•	The system must deliver standardized psychological tests (e.g., BDI-II) within the app.
•	The system must automatically score tests, including reverse-scored items.
•	The system must include a test repository visible only to the therapist, who assigns tests selectively to patients.
•	The system must allow patients to view test results in simplified form, while keeping full interpretation with the therapist.
•	The system must include a Panic/Emergency button for the patient that triggers real-time alerts to the therapist.
•	The system must support an optional always-open communication channel during high-risk periods, enabled jointly by therapist and patient.
•	The system must support group therapy via secure group video or group chat, with capacity for ~12 participants moderated by the therapist.
•	The system must support asynchronous, encrypted messaging between sessions, including short voice notes.
•	The system must provide psychoeducational materials (articles, videos, etc.), which patients may access on demand.
•	The system must allow psychologists to curate or approve psychoeducational content; optionally an admin may upload content on their behalf.
•	The system must allow psychologists to track income and expenses relevant to their practice (e.g., rent, materials, professional fees).
•	The system must provide reminders for required tax submissions (e.g., ANAF declarations) and annual professional dues (e.g., Colegiul Psihologilor).
•	The system must provide access to continuing-education information, including conferences and workshops relevant to required annual credits.
•	The system must provide configurable break and wellbeing reminders for therapists (e.g., hydration, short breaks, eye rest).
•	The system must optionally provide mindfulness, breathing, or relaxation micro-exercises for therapists.
•	The system must optionally support medication reminders for therapists who use a personal plan.
•	The system must support parent/guardian-managed accounts for minors, where:
•	The parent controls permissions and consent.
•	The child accesses only appropriate educational content.
The interview validated many of the items from the document analysis (like the journal, mood tracker, panic button, etc.) and added more depth (e.g., how the psychologist envisions using them). It also brought new considerations (group therapy, financial tracking, etc.) that we added to our requirements list.
3. Team Brainstorming Session
Brainstorming is a group elicitation technique where participants freely generate and build upon ideas, requirements, or solutions. The participants were the four members of our development team. No external stakeholders were present, but we simulated different user perspectives (patient, psychologist, admin) to inspire diverse insights.
Brainstorming leverages the team’s collective creativity and technical knowledge to uncover missing or innovative ideas. It’s useful after initial elicitation to capture “unknown unknowns” and to expand upon what the client provided.
The team listed all known requirements from the interview and document analysis, then explored “what else” and “what if” questions for each major function (journaling, scheduling, etc.). Ideas such as AI-based mood prediction and gamification were discussed. After idea generation, we prioritized feasible and valuable suggestions, creating an enhanced and well-rounded set of requirements for client validation.

Identified Requirements (from Brainstorming): The brainstorming confirmed many of the requirements already gathered, and added a few new ones or refinements. We organized the final set of requirements into categories for clarity:
Patient-Facing System Requirements
•	The system must provide an emotional digital journal where patients can log thoughts, feelings, and automatic thoughts via text, emojis, or short audio notes.
•	The system must allow patients to share journal entries with their psychologist at their discretion.

•	The system must restrict administrator access to non-confidential functions unless explicitly authorized for clinical oversight.
•	The system must maintain audit logs of access and changes to sensitive data for regulatory compliance and security review.
Conclusion
In summary, we identified the key stakeholders and used three elicitation techniques to gather requirements for the “PSYCare România” therapy companion app. Through Document Analysis, we captured the client’s initial vision and industry standards; the Client Interview allowed us to clarify and expand on those ideas in the stakeholder’s own words; and a Team Brainstorming Session helped us uncover additional features and ensure we had a comprehensive set of requirements.
We have documented all the requirements elicited from our stakeholders above. These include a rich feature set for both patients and psychologists, ranging from daily mood tracking and journaling on the patient side to scheduling, record-keeping, and analytics on the therapist side, all wrapped in a secure and compliant platform.
This elicitation phase results will guide us in the next steps of the project. All requirements listed will serve as the foundation for the system’s design and development, even though not every “nice-to-have” may be built in the initial version.
